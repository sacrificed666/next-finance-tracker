## 🧾 Kinds and how they are valued

| Kind | Valuation | Return type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deposit` 🏦 | Accrual — the app compounds it | Capitalised **or** paid out, with a frequency | Classic bank deposit |
| `bonds` 📜 | Accrual | Coupons paid out (no choice) | Government or corporate bonds |
| `reit` 🏢 | Market value | Dividends paid out **or** reinvested | Generic property fund |
| `inzhur` 🏛️ | Market value from published NAV | Decided by the fund — see below | Inzhur certificates |
| `stocks` 📈 | Market value | Price growth (no payouts) | Shares or an index fund |
| `crypto` 🪙 | Market value from CoinGecko | Price growth | A single coin position |
| `other` 📦 | Market value | Price growth | Anything else you hold |

"Accrual" means the app computes today's value from the rate, the start date and the compounding
schedule. "Market value" means the position is worth what it is worth today, and the expected return
is only used to project forward.

## 🔁 Return types are automatic

`src/lib/returns.ts` decides which options a kind supports, so nothing nonsensical can be selected:

```ts
deposit → interest    choices: capitalise | pay out      (+ frequency when capitalised)
bonds   → coupons     choices: pay out
reit    → dividends   choices: pay out | reinvest
inzhur  → dividends or growth, depending on the fund
stocks  → growth      choices: reinvest (price growth)
crypto  → growth
other   → growth
```

The form shows a segmented control only when there is a real choice; otherwise it states the fact —
"Coupons are paid out to you — they are never added to the bond itself." Normalisation repairs old
entries, so a bond saved years ago as "compound monthly" becomes "coupons paid out".

## 🏛️ Inzhur funds

Three funds are supported, and everything about them is fetched rather than typed:

| Fund | Income | Linked currency | Published forecast |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inzhur REIT | Monthly dividends + capitalisation | USD | from 9.5% per year |
| Inzhur Energy | Capitalisation only | USD | 15% per year |
| Inzhur MilTech | Capitalisation only (fund reinvests coupons) | UAH | 25–29% per year |

`GET /api/inzhur` fetches each fund's public offer page server-side and extracts:

- **NAV per certificate** ("ВЧА на сертифікат"), used to value your position;
- **forecast yield**, including ranges such as `25–29%`;
- **actual yield over the last 12 months**, when the fund publishes it.

Results are cached in memory for 10 minutes, each request has a 12-second timeout, and the route
requires a session.

> [!NOTE]
> Opening or changing an Inzhur position loads NAV and yields automatically; the expected-return
> field is read-only because the fund publishes it. The hourly refresh updates NAV *and* the forecast
> for every Inzhur position at once, so nothing has to be typed or pressed.

> [!WARNING]
> Scraping depends on the published page structure. If Inzhur redesigns, the route falls back to the
> built-in defaults in `src/lib/inzhur.ts` — update the regular expressions in
> `src/app/api/inzhur/route.ts` when that happens.

## 🔮 Projections

`projectedSnapshot(inv, today, date)` looks one year ahead on the Balance page:

- accrual kinds grow by their contracted rate and schedule;
- market kinds with reinvested returns compound the expected rate;
- market kinds that pay out keep their value and accumulate `paidOut`, which the card shows as
  expected earnings;
- monthly top-ups are added as deposits, never counted as profit.

> [!CAUTION]
> Expected return is a forecast you enter (or that Inzhur publishes). It never changes what a
> position is worth today — only what the "in a year" row shows.

## 💹 Live prices

| Asset | Source | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cryptocurrency (accounts and positions) | CoinGecko | The hourly refresh, **Load prices** in the account form, or saving a coin without a price |
| Inzhur certificates | inzhur.reit via `/api/inzhur` | The hourly refresh, opening the investment form, **Load NAV** |

Prices refresh on their own every hour on the hour, and immediately after a load when the stored
prices are older than an hour. Only one browser tab runs each hourly refresh.

Every position stores `pricedAt`, shown as a tooltip and in the card, so you always know how fresh
the number is.

> [!TIP]
> CoinGecko rate-limits anonymous callers. If a refresh fails, the app keeps the previous prices and
> shows the error inline instead of clearing your portfolio.
